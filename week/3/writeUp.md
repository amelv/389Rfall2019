Getting mother’s maiden name and the city she was born:

I would bring up in the conversation about the upcoming Maryland vs Penn State football game, somewhere in the lull of our technical conversation. We’d then begin discussing college football, where I would bring up that I’m a Maryland alumni. Eric Norman seems to be a pretty big Texas football fan, so he would likely quickly bring up that he went to Texas, would like bring to some nice banter about how Maryland keeps beating Texas at football. This would lower his defenses as we have an enjoyable conversation. I’d then ask if he’s from Texas, mentioning that (lying) my mother grew up in Houston, Texas. I might give a little back story, talking about my grandmother from Texas, saying that my mother’s maiden was actually Norman as well. I would then joking ask if his mother’s maiden is my last name. I’ll ask maybe we could be related. Both of these details would hopefully get Eric to reveal both his mother’s maiden name and where his mother grew up.

Getting what browser his mother uses:

Hopefully, this humorous encounter would continue, where I would then joke about my mother’s poor technical skills. I’d mention how Eric should help her out with stuff, that I don’t know a lot about security but I know enough that it's bad. Likely Eric, as a cybersecurity analyst whose parents treated him like an IT assistant every time he visits home, would also mention the ridiculously of his mother’s lack of tech literacy. I’d mention how mine still calls the Internet explorer icon “the internet”, but that I downloaded Chrome for her. I might ask if that’s a good browser. If he didn’t mention already what his mom uses, I might just ask what browser does he recommend as I’ll talk to him as if he’s some IT expert. I’d assume his recommendation is what his mother uses.

Getting the PIN number of his mother:

I’d then go on to mention my mother’s pin is 1234. Likely if Eric also talks about the poor skills of his mother and mentions her phone’s pin number, I could assume his mother’s phone pin number is also her ATM pin number.

Improve the standards for passwords. The administrator password was easily cracked with wordlists and was short. Important passwords should be done under a password manager. This gives an encrypted password that a hacker will not be able to crack.

Implement Intrusion Detection Systems/Prevention systems through a well-implemented firewall. One should not be able to run nmap on the web servers without some detection notifying the administrator, and thus should have some prevention for such snooping (such as blacklisting the IP immediately). Similarly, the network should check if it is receiving a mass number of packages trying to authentication, preventing a brute force attack; you could add a max number of attempts before a waiting period.
