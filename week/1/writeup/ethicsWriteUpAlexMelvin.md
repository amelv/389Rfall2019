My first step would be to inform my boss and emphasize the severity of such security issues. Hopefully, my boss and the overall company would take the right steps to ensure no product is released containing any of these remaining problems. If, however, my boss would not be willing to postpone, or has routinely shown mere ambivalence towards these security issues, I then would consider alerting a consumer watchdog. I would make sure they, or some sort of publication, would report the security issues to the public only if the ECU was not yet released. While some may feel reporting such negligence by a large company to the public is needed, it must be done in a calculated manner depending on the situation. The exploits should not be made public if the ECU is released; this gives time for people to exploit the ECU before the massive recall is done, and lots of harm could occur in this time span. Hopefully the consumer watchdog could build some legal case so that my company would be fined or forced to recall. 

Doing nothing in this situation does make me in part responsible to the harm in could cause, since I am able to prevent such harm from occurring. One may ask about the consequences of reporting their employer, seeing that they could be unemployed after such an event. Any harm done by punishments from my company towards me, however, will pale in comparison to the harm done by an exploited ECU.
